# CS-255: System Analysis and Design
The purpose of this readme is to showcase the system analysis and design process taken in developing the DriverPass application.

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project arose from recognizing that too many people are failing their driver licensing tests. The company is focused on providing training to prospective drivers in the form of online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training with a driving instructor. The system designed for this project was a registration and progress tracking system for the training that DriverPass provides.

## What did you do particularly well?
A highlight of my project was my analysis of the DriverPass system's requirements, particularly relating to potential platform constraints and security practices. I felt my emphasis on data privacy and previous system administration experience allowed me to have a unique perspective on some of the issues DriverPass would face during the development process, such as adaptability to modern security requirements or hardware suggestions.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part of my work I would potentially revise would be some of my UML diagrams, particularly the activity diagrams. While it is important to have an appropriate level of detail on order the make sure the diagram can still be easily understood, I think there is room for additional detail for processes like authentication, performing system maintenance, or some of the use cases that have dependencies.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
My interpretation of the user's needs was derived primarily from a transcript of the interview between DriverPass management and our own project lead and the previous system analyst. The client was able to describe what they wanted the system to be able to accomplish, along with a visual mockup of what they envisioned the system to look like. Based on the information the DriverPass team provided, we were able to set expectations for the project's deliverables early on and plan timelines accordingly, so that both sides of the project were on the same page regarding final expectations.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software stems from my personal interests in minimalism, data privacy, and security. Much of the modern tech landscape is based around the customer being the product itself- while they are provided a service, it is often at the cost of their personal data, so I want to focus on creating a quality end product that is able to stand on its own, and would not rely on compromising customers' information to be profitable. In the future, my analysis would be focused on trying to minimize friction between the user and what they are trying to accomplish as a core belief. This way, I can try to avoid overcomplicating my system design (potentially overextending resources) while prioritizing functionality.
